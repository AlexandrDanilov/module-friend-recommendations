# SwiftOtter_FriendRecommendations

Simple proof of concept for creating Friend Recommendations lists.

Contains the basic data structure and service layer allowing users to create a list of SKUs to share with a friend (via email)
as recommendations, with a personalized note. Once a user receiving such recommendations registers an account matching the
email address, they should be able to fetch their recommendation lists and their products.

The module contains the basic schema for GraphQL types, queries, and mutations. This module is designed as a starter for
building the appropriate GraphQL resolvers in conjunction with the SwiftOtter course Navigating GraphQL in Adobe Commerce.
